**📝 How the contract works:
Players join by sending the exact ticketPrice to the contract.
When the maxPlayers limit is reached, a random winner is chosen.
The winner receives the entire balance of the contract.
The lottery resets for the next round.


****🚨 Security Note:
**The random number is generated using on-chain data and is not truly random—for real randomness, consider using Chainlink VRF.**
